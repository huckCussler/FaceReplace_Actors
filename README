This is a version of the FaceReplace program, a simple face-matching application, written in Java7 and Habanero
Java (HJ) 1.3.1.  In order to run the code one must first have both Java7 and HJ installed.  HJ can be obtained
at:

https://upc-bugs.lbl.gov/~phargrov/sc12/PGAS-SC12/content/habanero/habanero/WIKI_RIC/CONFLUEN/DISPLAY/HABANERO/HJ_DOWNL.HTM

Once installed, running this application should only require running 'make' from the root directory.  This will
compile the source code and run the application.  Some things to note.  This version of FaceReplace is meant for
running timing tests, so there is no GUI component attached.  Instead, the user will see some output that displays
the results of running the application several times over on a given problem size.

The default problem size, determined by the 'run' command in the Makefile, is 512 x 512.  This means that the 
application will run using 512 subimages, each of size 512 x 512 pixels.  Other image sizes are provided in the

rawImgsForTimingTests

directory should one want to run the program with other image sizes.

There are also the following options in the Makefile:

runSingle -- runs the application utilizinig only one thread

runStealHelp -- runs the application using the HJ settings for work-stealing workers that are set to help first.

See the HJ documentation, especially the paper at

www.cs.rice.edu/~vs3/PDF/hj-pppj11.pdfâ€Ž

for more details on specifics about the HJ runtime.
